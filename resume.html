    <u> MULTI DISEASE PREDICTION USING Machine Learning:</u>
    <ul type="dought">
        <pr>
            <li>A dedicated and results-driven data scientist with a strong focus on predictive modeling for
            healthcare applications. My project involved creating a comprehensive, multi-disease prediction system to
            identify several high-burden illnesses, including Breast Cancer, Kidney Disease, Diabetes, Heart Disease,
            and Malaria, at their earliest stages.</li> <br>
           <li> I developed a flexible API using Python and Flask, which allows for the analysis of multiple diseases from a
            single patient report, thereby eliminating the need to deploy numerous individual models. This approach not
            only streamlines the diagnostic process but also significantly reduces the cost of patient analysis.<br></li> 
           <li>  My work is driven by a passion for leveraging technology to improve patient outcomes and proactively warn
            individuals of potential health risks. I have experience in using Python pickling to save and load machine
            learning models, ensuring the system can be easily expanded to include new diseases in the future. My goal
            is to combat rising mortality rates by providing timely and accurate health insights.
